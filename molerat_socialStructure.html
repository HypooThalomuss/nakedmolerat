<center><p>Naked mole rats are one of the few mammals that are eusocial. Now, you may be wondering:</p></center>
<h3>What is eusocialality?</h3>
<p>Eusociality is considered the highest degree of sociality. If a species is eusocial, then they live in a colony or group where individual "workers" that help care for offspring of inviduvial(s) who are able to reproduce. In the case of the naked mole rat, the only individual that is psychically able to reproduce is the queen along with 1-3 males that are chosen by the queen. </p>

<p>Any individuals that are not able to reproduce either defend the colony from predators, or are "workers". Workers perform tasks such as burrowing tunnels, finding food, and other tasks necessary for the care of the queen and her offspring.</p>
<h3>How is a queen selected?</h3>
<p>During a time in which a new queen must be chosen is the period of time where there is the most conflict within the colony. To choose a new queen, all the female mole rats in the colony gain the physical ability to reproduce. Then they engage in physical combat which can often end in death. The new queen is the female that is able to produce offspring first. All the other female naked mole rats lose the ability to reproduce once again and become soldiers/workers. In terms of how non-queen female naked mole rats are able to have their ability to reproduce supressed during a queen's reign, there are some theories. One is that When they roll around in the queen's urine in order to be recognized by other members of the colony, pharemones in the urine supress their ability to reproduce.</p>
